ParticipantData
	For each participant a .tsv file containing: 
	
	(a) data collected through the profile questionnaire, 
	
	(b) the combination of program types (crowded, spaced) viewed by the participant
	
	(c) for each program, their comprehension performance. Researcher assessed according 
		to the following criteria:
	
		10 = correct; 9,8 = one minor mistake reflecting gap in comprehension; 7,6 = output or function described incompletely but evidence of overall understanding; 5,4 = incorrect output and limited understanding; 3,2 = completely wrong understanding of program; 1 = no answer.
		
	(d) participant self-assessment of performance 
	
	(e) viewing time (milliseconds) for each stimulus in the Tobii timeline as per 3.2 and 
	
	(f) Tobii Pro Lab values for actual distance from eye tracker to eye (mm), gaze samples%
		(the ratio of correctly identified eye-tracking samples to the theoretical maximum) and Validation Accuracy (degrees).

sessions
	Full recording session data file as generated by the Tobii Pro Lab export feature is provided in tsv format. The data items in each file include:
	(a) the recording time stamp (milliseconds), 
	(b) detailed calibration data, 
	(c) gaze point and eye position coordinates, 
	(d) recording events and stimulus events (e.g program 1 stimulus start, program 1 stimulus end), 
	(e) eye movement type (fixation, saccade) and its duration, and 
	(f) AOI hits. 
	
videos
	For each participant, gaze plot videos (MP4) for each program "review" stimulus.

heatmaps
	Two categories of heat map are provided: absolute fixation count and absolute fixation duration. 
	For each program, there is a heat map showing the gaze metric for:
	(a) all participants, 
	(b) programmers with dyslexia and 
	(c) programmers without dyslexia.

metrics
	For each program type, a file (.tsv) containing the full set of Tobii gaze metrics for each area of interest (AOI):
	
	P1Ca
	P1Sa
	P2Ca
	P2Sa
	P3Ca
	P3Sa
